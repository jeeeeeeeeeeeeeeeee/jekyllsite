<h3> Music </h3>
<p> I have actually produced, both by myself and with others, a fair amount of music. I don't consider myself a musician. Most of what I've had a significant hand in shaping/creating is noise music. I do not play any instruments. Often I am, when with others, a "vocalist" because "singer" would be an incorrect description. I have had the pleasure, despite my musical impediments, of working only with people I very much respect. </p>
<p> I'm currently in a "collective" called <a href="http://mxr-aceetthnos.bandcamp.com/"><i> Mixed Race Ethno-State. </i></a>
The album embedded below, from that same bandcamp, is exclusively my work. <b style="font-size:9px"> Note: it is abrassive.</b>
