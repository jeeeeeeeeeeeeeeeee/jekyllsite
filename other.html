<h3> Music </h3>

<p> I have actually produced, both by myself and with others, a fair amount of music. I don't consider myself a musician. Most of what I've had a significant hand in shaping/creating is noise music. I do not play any instruments. Often I am, when with others, a "vocalist" because "singer" would be an incorrect description. I have had the pleasure, despite my musical impediments, of working only with people I very much respect. </p>
<p> I'm currently in a very avant, "free-improv" jazz and noise "collective" called <a href="http://mxr-aceetthnos.bandcamp.com/"><i> Mixed Race Ethno-State, </i></a> a group that otherwise is comprised of very talented musicians. Most of the work on the bandcamp is the result of collaborations between various members of the over all group, but the album embedded on the right from the aforementioned group is predominately my work. Outside of that project, I also upload noise tracks to a soundcloud on occasion. The division between the Mixed Race tracks that only I worked on and the tracks on Soundcloud attributed only to me is arbitrary, but up to this point I've only uploaded <a href="https://soundcloud.com/66768419/white-light-white-heat"> Harsh Noise Wall</a> tracks to Soundcloud. </p>
<p> I was in two bands years back. One of them, Petty, recorded and released music, to which I will not be linking. The other, S'Hiver, did not. I also collaborated, in college, with a few composers, most notably Judy Jackson, for whom I still have incredible respect and with whom I am still friends. (Portions of <i>Goomah</i> [see the <a href="/words.html"> words </a> page] were written in accordance with one of Judy's graphic scores.) None of these pieces were recorded. </p>
<h3> Fuck Town, a webcomic </h3>

<p> For a very short amount of time, I made a webcomic called >Fuck Town. It only had eight installments. It became the basis for <i> Goomah </i> (again, see the <a href="/words.html"> words </a> page.) Because it indirectly led to what is almost certainly my most substantial work to date, I'm reposting it here in full. The comic above links to the rest</p>
<h3> Gun Kids </h3>
<p> It's foolish and embarrassing to link to a series of tweets on a portfolio website, but I can't think of another way of conveying the &mdash;also foolish and embarrassing&mdash; fact that I consider this ongoing project to be an actual <i> project </i> in a way my
 other tweets are not. The gun kids are a series of young boys with guns saying things. </p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">all my gun kids so far excluding a few:</p>&mdash; deranged jessi (@jejesjesijessi) <a href="https://twitter.com/jejesjesijessi/status/1066885365863071744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
