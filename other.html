<div> <h3> Fuck Town, a webcomic </h3>
<p> For a very short amount of time, I made a webcomic called <a href="/comicone.html">Fuck Town</a>. It only had eight installments. It became the basis for <i> Goomah </i> (again, see the <a href="/words.html"> words </a> page.) Because it indirectly led to what is almost certainly my most substantial work to date, I'm reposting it here in full.</p></div>
<h3> Gun Kids </h3>

 other tweets are not. The gun kids are a series of young boys with guns saying things. </p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">all my gun kids so far excluding a few:</p>&mdash; deranged jessi (@jejesjesijessi) <a href="https://twitter.com/jejesjesijessi/status/1066885365863071744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
