<h3> Significant Projects </h3>

  <i> <a href="https://www.fullspectrumfeatures.com/blackpill"> Blackpill </a> </i> is my first short film as a writer/director. It's a sci fi horror movie. As the Coronavirus struck full force it was accepted into its first two festivals (one in Canada!).
  Only time will tell when & where it has its actual premiere, considering the state of things!

  <i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOUm7N_h264&list=PLjpnzmMm7_gzhyX9F9vFzwzMN8UIMKuvk"> Tha Park </a> </i> is a couple different things! It started, as evidenced by the youtube playlist linked in the foregoing sentence, as a shitty, no budget "web series" basically handmade by my two friends (Harley & Owen) and I.
  For the past year or so, we've been trying to reboot it in a more "acceptable" and less "god awful" way. Our most recent shoot got called off on account of one of our actors coming down with a case of the 'rona. With any luck, though, we'll be holding screenings by September!

<h3> Casual Projects </h3>
<p>
  In the next month I'll technically double the number of "works" of "film" I've managed to eke out of my "life." During the quarantine that also resulted in this website, I was involved in:
</p>
<p>
  <i> Joel Quest </i> a flicker film qua bit all about my friend, Joel, set to a noise track I made.
</p>
<p>
  <i> Quarantine </i> a short I directed, shot, co-wrote, and co-edited. It stars Harley and Owen, both of whom had a hand in writing it, the former of whom had a hand in editing it.
