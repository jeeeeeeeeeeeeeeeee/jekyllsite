<h3> Significant Projects </h3>

<p>
  <i> <a href="https://www.fullspectrumfeatures.com/blackpill"> Blackpill </a> </i> is my first short film as a writer/director. It's a sci fi horror movie. As the Coronavirus struck full force it was accepted into its first two festivals. Since then it's been selected for two more, making for a total of four spread across three countries!
  It's playing <a href="https://insideout.ca/toronto-films/shorts-warm-blood/"> Inside Out </a> next month!

  <i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOUm7N_h264&list=PLjpnzmMm7_gzhyX9F9vFzwzMN8UIMKuvk"> Tha Park </a> </i> is a couple different things! It started, as evidenced by the youtube playlist linked in the foregoing sentence, as a no budget "web series" basically handmade by my two friends (Harley & Owen) and I.
  For the past year or so, we've been trying to reboot it in a more "acceptable" and less "god awful" way. As a result of our endeavoring to do that, we got into the final round of the Sundance Makers' Lab. Here's our <a href="https://vimeo.com/373021668"> application video. </a> We also won a 10k dollar post-production grant through <a href="https://www.thefilmfund.co/"> The Film Fund. </a> We finally finished shooting in August, and with any luck, we'll be dropping it online in less than a year!

<h3> Casual Projects </h3>
<p>
  During the quarantine that also resulted in this website, I was involved in:
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unkpNXX9Z7U"><i> Joel Quest, </i></a> a flicker film qua bit all about my friend, Joel, set to a noise track I made.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="/quarantinemovie.html"><i> Quarantine, </i></a> a short I directed, shot, co-wrote, and co-edited. It stars Harley and Owen, both of whom had a hand in writing it, the former of whom had a hand in editing it.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDj82qMmRUU"><i>McKinley Park, </i></a> a short documentary I made during a period in which I was not safe in my own neighborhood because Latin King's were attacking random black people on the street.
</p>
<h3> Bragging </h3>
<p> On top of the grants & festivals associated with finished projects, Harley Foos & I's film concept <i> Gay Harley/Straight Harley </i> made it to the final round of Inside Out Film Festival's Pitch, Please competition.
